The features selected for this dataset come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ.

The time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50Hz.

Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm. These are denoted with the suffix 'mag'.

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals to produce new variables. These are denoted with the prefix 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals.

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
